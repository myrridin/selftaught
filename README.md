# How to Be a Self-Taught Programmer
This repo is the one page info site for my class "How to Be a Self-Taught Programmer".

## About the Class

This is an 8 week introduction to programming class with an emphasis on teaching and practicing the skill of self development in your craft. It will walk students through the basic concepts of software development, then branch as the class decides to learn interesting technologies and put them to use in live web applications. This is a small class with high interaction and a fast pace, designed for highly motivated students who want to be able to continue advancing on their own after the class is over.
